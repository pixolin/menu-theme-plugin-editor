# WordPress-Plugin: Menu Plugin Theme Editor

When using block based themes, the menu item for the plugin and theme editor is hidden. This plugin replaces the menu items.

Please make sure, that you didn't disable the menu entries with `define( 'DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', true );` or by using a security plugin.

## Installation
* Download the plugin as zip-file via the code button on this web page.
* Go to the Plugin menu in your WordPress backend, install, upload plugin and upload the zip-file. After plugin activation, the menu items should show up.
